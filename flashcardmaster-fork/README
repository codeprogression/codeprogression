Tips:
    * Merging files with different number of fields.
       First, Open the source file and use the editor to add fields to 
       match the target file, you can also reorder fields by dragging
       and dropping them (in Card Designer). Then, use the import method 
       as ususal.
    * You can transform flash card data into any text-based format 
      (csv, text) by using XSLTs. When file is saved with .html extension, FCM
      uses the xsl stylesheet file located at:
      "C:\Documents And Settings\<user>\Application Data\Nithin Philips
        \Flash Card Master\<version>\Style.xslt"
      The stylesheet included in FCM is only written to the file when required 
      and only if it does not exist. You can also edit the default
      stylesheet to suit your needs (add a banner etc.)
      see Documentation for the DTD and Schema of the XML to process.
    * You can set the foreground or background color of any field 
      by manually editing the .cml files (Note: you cannot edit .card files,
      as they are binary). On elements called 'Field', there are attributes
      named 'forecolor' and 'backcolor', you can set their values. Format for
      entering color is "argb(<alpha>,<red>,<green>,<blue>)", each channel 
      can values ranging from 0 to 255, inclusive. For example, for a green
      color you enter "argb(255,155,216,30)". Alpha values control the 
      translucency of the color.
