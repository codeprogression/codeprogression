      <CardField name="String">From 1935, Avniel lived in Haifa, and in 1958 he participated in the Venice Biennale. While he is best known as a leading Israeli artist, Avniel was also a prominent lawyer in Haifa and a founding partner of the firm Avniel, Salomon &amp; Co. He was a regular participant in the group exhibitions of the Painters and Sculptors' Association of Israel and, among other achievements, was awarded the following accolades during his lifetime: Herman Struck Prize (1952), Tenth Anniversary Prize for Watercolours, Ramat Gan (1958), Histadrut Prize (1961), and First Prize Haifa Municipality (1977). He represented Israel at the 1962 International Art Seminar at Fairleigh Dickenson University, was a member of the Artists' Colony in Safed, and maintained an active studio on Mount Carmel in the Haifa environs. Avniel's works can be found in museums and private collections in Israel and abroad (see below for a detailed list). He died in 1989.</CardField>
